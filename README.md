# <p align=center> <a name="top">Flappy Bird </a></p>  

## Description
This game was created as my first project using Python and pygame module. To start the game, press the 'space' key. All you have to do is just click the spacebar to raise the bird so that it fits between the pipes. Pipes are randomly generated. Every five points (earned after flying through the gap) the game speed increases, so it gets garder and harder. When you touch the bottom or top edge of the screen or the pipe, the game is over.

This app was created for educational purposes.
